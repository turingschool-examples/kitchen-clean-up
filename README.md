# Kitchen Clean Up

Cleaning up the kitchen after a big meal isn't the best part of the holidays, but someone's got to do it!

I might have had too much eggnog when I made this app, can you refactor it? 

Remember, when you're refactoring, its important to change the _code quality_, not the functionality or styles. Here are some things to consider:
* Are there areas where you can make a helper function to reuse? 
* Opportunities to use parameters
* Spacing and indentation
* Reusable classes for your CSS
* Naming conventions (HTML, CSS and JS)!
* Make sure HTML is semantic
* Determine which functions can and should be pure. Review [this lesson](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-1/js-pure-functions.html) if you need.


**BONUS**
* Can you identify a use case for a closure? If so, refactor to utilize one! Review [this lesson](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-2/closures.html) if you need. 
* This user interface isn't great either. How could you make it more useable? A few things that stand out: 
  * Its not clear which elements are clickable
  * The page refresh is a little jarring
  * The images take a long time to load
  * What else could be better?
* Additional features:
  * Ability to add a new totally true fact about kitchens
  * Unique facts each time 
  * Whatever you think!
